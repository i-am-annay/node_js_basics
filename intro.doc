Javascript Engine
- Computers do not understand Javascript
- A Javascript engine takes Javascript, and converts it into something that it does understand: machine code

V8 engine
- Node.js is written in C++
- At the heart of Node.js is the V8 engine
- The V8 engine converts our Javascript into machine code
    Javascript -> [C++ + Node.js + V8] -> Machine Code
